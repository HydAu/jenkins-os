The createPullRequest function creates a new pull request on GitHub.  It will
perform the entire session of API operations, so it is not necessary to manage
connection handles, etc.

Parameters must be given as named arguments.  The following parameters are for
password authentication.

  - username: The GitHub user that will perform the action
  - password: The GitHub user's password for authentication

To use a personal access token, the following parameter overrides the above.

  - token: An OAuth token, instead of username and password

The following parameters define the content of the pull request.

  - upstreamProject (required): The project that will receive the pull request,
    given in the form "<owner>/<name>"
  - upstreamBranch (optional): The branch in upstreamProject being requested
    for merging, defaults to "master"
  - sourceOwner (optional): The GitHub user or organization that owns the fork
    of upstreamProject, defaults to the given username (or token's user)
  - sourceBranch (optional): The branch in sourceOwner's forked repository that
    is requesting to merge into upstreamBranch, defaults to "master"
  - title (required): The title of the pull request
  - message (optional): The message body of the pull request (in Markdown)
