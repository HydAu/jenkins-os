The createPullRequest function creates a new pull request on GitHub.  It will
perform the entire session of API operations, so it is not necessary to manage
connection handles, etc.

Parameters must be given as named arguments, from the following possibilities:

  - username (required): The GitHub user that will perform the action
  - password (required): The GitHub user's password for authentication
  - upstreamProject (required): The project that will receive the pull request,
    given in the form "<owner>/<name>"
  - upstreamBranch (optional): The branch in upstreamProject being requested
    for merging, defaults to "master"
  - sourceOwner (optional): The GitHub user or organization that owns the fork
    of upstreamProject, defaults to the given username
  - sourceBranch (optional): The branch in sourceOwner's forked repository that
    is requesting to merge into upstreamBranch, defaults to "master"
  - title (required): The title of the pull request
  - message (optional): The message body of the pull request (in Markdown)
