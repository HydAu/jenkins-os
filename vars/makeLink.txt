The makeLink function outputs a special string value that is represented as a
hyperlink on the Jenkins console.

It takes the target of the link as the first argument.  When given a string, it
is directly used as the target URL.  When given a Jenkins model object, the URL
that represents that object is used as the link target.  Links to most Jenkins
model types (builds, projects, etc.) should automatically include the adjacent
context menu drop-down with available actions and sidebar links.

It can optionally take a string as the second argument, to be used as the link
text that is printed on the console.  When omitted, the text is generated from
the first argument.
